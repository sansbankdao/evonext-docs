## Seed Phrase Best Practices

### What is a Seed Phrase?

A seed phrase (also known as a recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase) is a list of 12 or 24 words that stores all the information needed to recover your crypto wallet. Anyone with access to your seed phrase has control over your assets.

### Protection Strategies

:::tip Golden Rules

✅ Write down your seed phrase on paper and store it in multiple secure physical locations
✅ Consider using a fireproof and waterproof safe or safety deposit box
✅ Use phrases only meaningful to you when writing them down (avoid exact order)
✅ Consider splitting your seed phrase and storing parts in different locations

❌ Never store your seed phrase digitally (photos, notes apps, cloud storage)
❌ Never share your seed phrase with anyone, even if they claim to be from support
❌ Never enter your seed phrase on any website or application except your official wallet
❌ Never use the same seed phrase across different applications or platforms

## Password Management

### Choosing a Password Manager

    <icon-card icon="🏆" title="Bitwarden">
        Our recommended password manager. Open source, audited, and offers a reliable free tier for personal use.
    </icon-card>
    <icon-card icon="⚠️" title="LastPass">
        Has a history of security exploits. If you currently use LastPass, we strongly recommend migrating to a more secure alternative.

    <icon-card icon="🔍" title="Other Options">
        1Password and KeePass are also viable alternatives with strong security records.

### Setting Up Bitwarden

1. [Download Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/download/) for your devices
2. Create your account with a strong, unique master password
3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) immediately
4. Install browser extensions for autofill convenience
5. Import any existing passwords from other managers

:::tip Master Password Security

Your Bitwarden master password should be:
- At least 12-15 characters long
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Completely unique and not used anywhere else

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

### Recommended 2FA Methods

<icon-grid columns={2}>
    <icon-card icon="🔑" title="Hardware Keys">
        Consider using a physical security key like YubiKey or Google Titan for the highest level of protection.
    </icon-card>
    <icon-card icon="📲" title="Authenticator Apps">
        Use authenticator apps like Authy, Google Authenticator, or Aegis instead of SMS-based 2FA when possible.
    </icon-card>
</icon-grid>

## Device Security

### Securing Your Devices

- Keep your operating system and applications updated
- Use reputable antivirus/antimalware software
- Enable full-disk encryption (FileVault for Mac, BitLocker for Windows)
- Use strong passcodes on mobile devices
- Enable "find my device" features for recovery
- Avoid public Wi-Fi networks when accessing sensitive accounts

## Phishing Protection

### Recognizing Phishing Attempts

Phishing is a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity.

:::warning Watch Out For

- Unsolicited messages asking for personal information
- Urgent or threatening language to create panic
- Slightly misspelled domain names (evonext.app vs evonnext.app)
- Unexpected email attachments or links
- Requests to "verify your account" via external links

:::

### Verification Steps

1. Always verify URLs directly rather than clicking links in messages
2. Check for HTTPS encryption (padlock icon) in your browser
3. Bookmark important sites to ensure you're visiting the correct address
4. When in doubt, contact support through official channels only
