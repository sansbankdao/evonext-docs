    - Register a NEW Platform Identity (if you don't have one)

## Identity + Username Registration

If you're new to the Dash Platform, you'll need to create an identity before claiming a username. Here's how to get both set up in one seamless process:

:::tip Quick Start Option

The fastest way to get started is by using EvoNext, which will guide you through both identity creation and username registration in a user-friendly interface.

:::

### Step-by-Step Registration Process

```bash
// Access EvoNext web application
https://evonext.app

// Or download the desktop application
https://github.com/sansbankdao/evonext-desktop
```

Once you're in the application:

1. Select "Create Identity" from the main menu
2. Enter your seed phrase when prompted
3. Wait for identity confirmation on the blockchain (typically 1-2 minutes)
4. Navigate to the "Username Registration" section
5. Enter your desired username and confirm availability
6. Approve the transaction to register your username

Identity creation and username registration both require network fees. These are paid to the network for processing your transactions and are not collected by EvoNext.
