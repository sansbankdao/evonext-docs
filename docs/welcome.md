# Welcome To EvoNext

Let's discover **Why EvoNext? in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a NEW Dash Platform Identity**.

Or **try EvoNext immediately** by signing in at **[EvoNext.app/connect](https://evonext.app/connect)**.

### What you'll need

- [Download DashPay](https://www.dash.org/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing DashPay, you are recommended to KEEP YOUR SEED PHRASE SAFE.

## Generate a NEW Identity

Generate a NEW Dash Platform Identity using the **application onboarding process**.

Your new Identity will be created immediately.
Will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Register a NEW Username

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
